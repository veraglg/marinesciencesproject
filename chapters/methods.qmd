## Measuring principle

Plastic biodegradation, sometimes also referred to as mineralization, is a complex biochemical process that converts polymer organic constituents into new microbial biomass and inorganic matter through microbial activity [@eu2021]. Here, aerobic biodegradation is considered, which implies the production of carbon dioxide (CO~2~) in the presence of oxygen gas (O~2~) following the process:

$$
\ce{Plastic + O2(g) ->[Microbes] Biomass + CO2(g) + Minerals}
$$

Consequently, the biodegradation process is measurable by analyzing the amount of O~2~ consumed or, inversely, the amount of CO~2~ produced [@wtw2006]. The OxiTop\textsuperscript{\textregistered} Control test is designed to trap the produced CO~2~ as an insoluble precipitate inside a strongly alkaline solution of NaOH following the reaction:

$$
\ce{CO2(aq) + 2Na^+(aq) + 2OH^- + H2O -> Na2CO3(solid) + 2H2O}
$$

Therefore, pressure inside the reactor falls due to the sequestration of CO~2~ and biological oxygen demand (BOD) can be calculated from the observed pressure difference. According to the law of ideal gases, air pressure inside a rigid container only varies by two factors: variations in the number of gas molecules (i.e. oxygen consumption) and temperature [@tenny2025]. Because temperature inside the incubator chamber remains constant at 25 \textdegree C, OxiTop\textsuperscript{\textregistered} gauges will only measure a difference in pressure due to oxygen consumption [@wtw2006].

BOD was then calculated by following @eq-bod from the OxiTop\textsuperscript{\textregistered} Control operating manual under controlled testing conditions [@wtw2006]. Known parameters are oxygen gas molecular weight $M_{O_2}$ (32,000 mg O~2~ mol^-1^), the ideal gas constant $R$ (83.144 L hPa mol^-1^ K^-1^), incubation temperature $T$ (298.15 K), reference temperature $T_0$ (273.15 K = 0 \textdegree C), Bunsen absorption coefficient $\alpha$ (0.03103), the total volume of the vessel $V_t$ (995 mL), and the volume occupied by the two-phased medium $V_m$ (260 mL).

$$
BOD=\frac{M_{O_2}}{RT}\left(\frac{V_t-V_m}{V_m}+\alpha\frac{T}{T_0}\right)\Delta{}p_{O_2}
$$ {#eq-bod}

The test media inside the reactor simulated the benthic environment near the beach zone. @tosin2012 proposed a two-phase approach (sediment and water column) mimicking the conditions of a plastic item that has sunk to the sea floor. Unlike their study, this one used field samples instead of a synthetic aqueous solution to further resemble field conditions.

## Testing materials

Compostable plastic bags were provided by @deiss2025 in the context of the @soplas2024, as shown in @fig-ecovio. The material is commercially available under Ecovio\textsuperscript{\textregistered} trademark name [@basf2025] and is made by blending polylactic acid (PLA) and polybutylene adipate terephthalate (PBAT) polymers at variable proportions. PLA is synthesized from renewable feedstocks such as corn and sugar cane while PBAT has a nonrenewable fossil origin, the resulting blend is partially renewable-based. Ecovio\textsuperscript{\textregistered} is compostable certified under the European standard EN 13432 [@eubp2023]. Suggested by @tosin2012, laboratory-grade filter paper was employed as a positive control (+C) test material. Paper is composed of cellulose, a common polymer which is biodegradable in all types of aerobic conditions, including freshwater and saltwater [@nagamine2022]. According to a recent study by @beiras2023, compostable plastic bags show similar rates of biodegradation regardless of the degree of grinding. In this study, plastic films were cut into 20 mm diameter disk shapes (@fig-methods). The same process was used with a filter paper sheet [@tosin2012].

Ecovio\textsuperscript{\textregistered} biodegradation was tested after 30 days of exposure to a simulated benthic environment by incubating the material in a reactor medium pre-exposed to environmental conditions [@tosin2012]. Some authors also consider the effects of biodegradation by evaluating weight loss of the polymer [@lavagnolo2024]. This approach requires extensive incubation for long periods of time, e.g. @tosin2012 tested up to 24 months. The present methodology saves time by only evaluating the biochemical effects of biodegradation through oxygen consumption [@lopez2022].

Ecovio\textsuperscript{\textregistered} has polymer density higher than 1 g cm^-3^ [@behera2024], which results in negative buoyancy in water. However, tiny air bubbles adhered to the plastic surface, making it difficult to sink into the sediment. To solve the issue thorough clearing was applied using a pair of tweezers.

## Test design and procedure

Sediment and water samples were collected from 2 beaches of both freshwater and seawater environments in Andalusia, Spain. Sampled beaches are recognized under Blue Flag certification by the Foundation for Environmental Education [@adeac2024]. The focus of the study is to assess potential biodegradation in beaches under pressure from plastic pollution, therefore the Blue Flag offers a criteria for high occupation indicating a plastic littering hotspot [@eea2024].

Field sampling locations are shown in @fig-map. La Breña Reservoir is a freshwater body located in Almodóvar del Río, Córdoba ($37\textdegree 49'55.20''$N, $5\textdegree 2'12.84''$W). Adapted from @tosin2012, freshwater and sediment collection was carried out near the shore at a water depth of 1 m to ensure that the microbial community living in the sediment is fully adapted to submerged conditions. Secondly, Los Boliches Beach is located at the Mediterranean coast of Fuengirola, Málaga ($30\textdegree 32'52.44''$N, $4\textdegree 36'54.72''$W), which is highly urbanized and dedicated to tourism [@garzon2023]. Sampling was conducted at further distance to the shore at 2 m depth during mid-tide targeting the suborbital zone [@tosin2012].

The assessment included 3 incubation treatments for both lake and marine environments: Ecovio\textsuperscript{\textregistered}, cellulose (+C) and no polymer (-C), the former being the control for positive mineralization response and the latter the negative control where no response is expected [@tosin2012]. Tests were replicated into 4 separate reactors, resulting in a total size of 24. Additionally, 6 blank reactors were simultaneously incubated for quality assurance [@lopez2022].

Initially, 100 g of moist sediment were placed inside empty vessels followed by 200 mL of water from the corresponding field sample. Next, testing materials were deposited on the sediment floor using tweezers (@fig-methods). In order to maximize contact area with the surrounding medium, the disks were arranged so as to avoid overlapping. Each CO~2~ trap was filled with 50 mL of NaOH solution that had previously been prepared using solid pellets (1 mol L^-1^). 

OxiTop\textsuperscript{\textregistered} gauges were checked for sufficient battery life beforehand, they were also calibrated by a pneumatic test following the instructions provided by the manufacturer [@wtw2006]. Four metal clips placed equally apart were used to close each reactor separately, and a thin coating of grease was applied to the border tire to prevent air exchange. Lastly, reactors were positioned inside the incubator chamber at random (@fig-methods). To prevent the NaOH solution from spilling onto the medium and killing the microorganism, special care was taken.

The incubator chamber maintained a constant temperature of 25 \textdegree C in the dark. Daily measurements were taken until the end of the 30-day period. After the test, the reactors were dismantled, and the testing materials were recovered for visual inspection. Using software supplied by the vendor, data was gathered and stored in separate spreadsheet files for every test. A unified comma-separated values (CSV) file was created using tidy practices recommended by @wickham2025.

## Statistical considerations

A two-sample t-test was used to determine statistically significant results from BOD tests [@mcdonald2015]. Reactors were grouped into testing material (e.g. Ecovio\textsuperscript{\textregistered}) and negative controls (-C). The null hypothesis was rejected if the calculated p-value was less than 0.05 ($\alpha$ = 0.05), demonstrating a statistically significant biodegradation response. Test were performed using R package `stats` 4.5.0 function `t.test(var.equal = TRUE)` [@r2025].

As pointed out by @sullivan2010, BOD data has historically been fit to a single exponential model (SEM) defined by @eq-single-exp where $BOD_t$ is BOD at any time (mg O~2~ L^-1^), $BOD_u$ is the ultimate BOD (mg O~2~ L^-1^) which corresponds to the horizontal asymptote, and $k$ is the first-order biodegradation rate (days^-1^).

$$
BOD_t=BOD_u\ (1-e^{-kt})
$$ {#eq-single-exp}

However, it has long been recognized that SEM does not accurately fit BOD curves [@hewitt1975]. Alternatively, a double exponential model (DEM) offers a more robust approach to biodegradation kinetics [@mason2006] because it considers both labile and refractory components degradation at different rates. This more complex relation is established in @eq-double-exp where $BOD_{u1}$ and $BOD_{u2}$ correspond to the ultimate BOD of the labile and refractory components, respectively. The same distinction is made for both first-order biodegradation rates $k_1$ and $k_2$.

$$
BOD_t=BOD_{u1}(1-e^{-k_1t})+BOD_{u2}(1-e^{-k_2t})
$$ {#eq-double-exp}

Nonlinear models were fitted using the *R* package `nls.multstart` version 2.0.0 developed openly by @padfield2025. This package allows for multiple start parameters and automatically selects the best fitting option based on least squares regression. The selection of the best fitting equation was based on the Akaike information criterion (AIC) where the smaller the AIC, the better fit. The metric can be calculated using @eq-aic, which is valid when the same data is used to estimate different parameters [@portet2020]. In @eq-aic, $N$ is the number of observations and $K$ is the number of estimated parameters, and $RSS$ is the residual sum of squares.

$$
AIC = N \ln{\frac{RSS}{N}}+2K
$$ {#eq-aic}
