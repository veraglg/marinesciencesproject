# Introduction {#sec-intro}

Plastic pollution has become a global concern attracting much attention from the environmental science community in recent years [@macleod2021]. The issue is particularly alarming in the context of the Global Ocean were an estimate annual flux of 11 million tons of plastic reach the ocean every year [@reddy2020]. Current predictions claim the problem will worsen as global chains of production and consumption develop at an accelerating rate driven by the «business as usual» economic model [@oecd2022]. In an attempt to establish a safe operating space, @rockstrom2009 first defined nine planetary boundaries ensuring the integrity of Earth system equilibrium (@fig-pb). It was then submitted that the planetary boundary for plastic pollution is already transgressed, warning that plastic production outpaces the capacity for environmental safety assessment and monitoring [@persson2022]. As of the time of this study, 6 out of 9 boundaries are already breached [@richardson2023]. Applying this framework, @villarrubia2018 emphasizes the ecological impact of marine plastic and its role in biodiversity loss, which is considered a core planetary boundary. The argument presented by @amigas2021 condemns current business practices based on greenwashing strategies designed to sustain profits in a linear economy, which is widely accepted as the root of the problem [@eu2025].

Overwhelming evidence proves that plastic polymers persist in the environment and tend to accumulate rapidly [@geyer2017] whereas engineered remediation strategies are unlikely to succeed in preventing poorly reversible damage [@macleod2021]. The ubiquity of plastic in the ocean is such that plastic bags have been captured on camera as deep as 10,000 meters below sea level [@jamieson2022], also high quantities of microplastics have been characterized in the remoteness of arctic deep-sea sediment [@bergmann2017].

Plastic pollution has devastating consequences on marine biodiversity, in a review study @gall2015 found that 17% of marine species affected by entanglement and ingestion are listed on the IUCN Red List. Recent evidence suggests that some seabirds of the order *Procellariiformes* (e.g. albatrosses and petrels) are highly vulnerable to poisoning due to the olfactory trap of plastic fouling [@savoca2016]. Moreover, potentially invasive species disperse on top of plastic debris rafting across thousands of kilometers [@carlton2017]. In the context of a warming climate, tropical sessile species can more easily travel into template seas. Such is the case for the invasive barnacle *Elminius modestus*, reported colonizing plastic debris as far north as the Shetland Islands (60\textdegree N) in the Atlantic [@barnes2005].

Microplastics are of particular consideration due to their higher aquatic mobility and biological penetration, posing great challenges in determining their distribution [@andersen2024]. They can adsorb heavy metals [@holmes2012] and persistent organic pollutants [@rochman2013], increasing their overall toxicity. Moreover, the additives they contain are a dangerous mixture of synthetic chemicals that cause acute mortality at low concentrations, such is the case of a rubber tire antioxidant reported to cause mass death in wild salmon [@tian2021].

A pressing need for immediate political action has lead to the recent prohibition of some single use plastic products at the same time corporate interest moves towards novel plastic polymers based on renewable feedstocks and are advertised as biodegradable under the umbrella term «bioplastic» [@eubp2025]. Despite their promising potential, commercially available bioplastics are only partially bio-based or exhibit incomplete biodegradability [@oceana2022]. Current regulations focus on industrial composting where a threshold biodegradation percent is obtained under controlled conditions, including temperatures of 60 \textdegree C [@farah2016] which are rarely found in the natural environment.

Pioneering field experiments have shown heterogeneous results concerning bioplastic potential biodegradability in the marine environment depending on polymer composition and environmental factors such as salinity, temperature and microbial diversity [@lott2021]. PLA is largely acknowledged as being resistant to biodegradation in marine conditions [@royer2023]. On the other hand, research focus on fast and simple standardized tests to assess marine biodegradation of novel synthetic polymers [@lopez2022]. However, a systematic review by @lavagnolo2024 concluded that the lack of consensus between test methods at different environmental conditions hinders environmental safety assessment. Following the previously mentioned outpace at which new blends of polymers flood the market [@persson2022], thorough environmental research falls behind leaving a gap of knowledge on the ultimate fate of bioplastics and their byproducts in the ocean [@ribba2022].

The aim of this study is to determine the ultimate fate of Ecovio\textregistered\ compostable plastic bags in the aquatic environment employing fast and replicable testing methods [@lopez2022]. The relevance of microbes living in the sediment was also investigated, as proposed in the pioneering work of @tosin2012, by recreating the open environment in the laboratory. In an attempt to bridge the gap in novel compostable plastics biodegradation under different environmental conditions [@lavagnolo2024], lake and marine benthic environments were studied using field samples from two popular beach locations in Andalusia, Spain. Plastic biodegradation is a process in which microbes convert all of its constituents to new microbial biomass, gases and minerals [@eu2021]. This process may take years at environmentally relevant conditions [@pelegrini2016]. In order to provide relevant results in a reasonable period of time, a highly sensitive test method based on biological oxygen demand (BOD) was adopted [@tosin2012]. In most cases, only 30 days were required to determine ultimate biodegradability using estimated parameters from nonlinear regression models [@padfield2025].
