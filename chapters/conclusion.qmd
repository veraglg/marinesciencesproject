# Conclusion

This findings into the biodegradation of Ecovio\textsuperscript{\textregistered} within simulated benthic environments provides a valuable insight into the challenges of addressing plastic pollution with biotechnological solutions. The nearly complete integrity of the recovered Ecovio\textsuperscript{\textregistered} samples, together with a negative BOD test response, highlights the doubtful fast biodegradability of PLA and PBAT blends in lake and marine environments. Furthermore, this research underscores the complexity of biodegradation processes and emphasizes the need for more accurate modelling tools like DEM to correctly predict and manage the fate of emerging materials. While, DEM demonstrated improved accuracy in characterizing the biodegradation kinetics compared to traditional SEM, the limited time scope of the test, should be taken with care. Moreover, a truly effective strategy requires a multifaceted approach encompassing reduced plastic production, improved waste management, and a fundamental shift towards circular economy. Without fundamental planetary boundaries safety, the promise of compostable plastics like Ecovio\textsuperscript{\textregistered} will ultimately fall short. Continued research must focus not only on optimizing their biodegradability but also on addressing the broader systemic issues driving the overwhelming accumulation of plastic in our oceans.
